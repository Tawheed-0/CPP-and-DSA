// Errors are of three types 
// -> Syntax error.
// ->logical error.
// ->Runtime error.

// Syntax error and logical error are the errors which are due to the mistake of programmer and can be overcomed by the compiler and debugger respectfully.
// But the user is responsible for runtime errors due to either entering bad input or unavailibility/problem of resources.
// These errors are also known as exceptions.

// Due to these errors programs stop abruptily and doesn't specify the problem to the user. to overcome that C++ gives us concept of exception handling whose main objective is to give user the proper message informing about the exact problem and also provide him guidance to solve the problem.
